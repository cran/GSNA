\description{
This function returns the negative of a numeric or integer vector or matrix. This may be suitable as the
\code{matrix_scaling_fun()} argument for \code{gsnPareNetGenericHierarchic()} when being used with such distance metrics
as the Jaccard Index or Szymkiewiczâ€“Simpson Overlap Coefficients to transform them into something more approximating a
distance in behavior.
}
\details{
This function also sets matrix or vector attributes appropriately for negation of the input.
