	abstract = {Motivation: The result of a typical microarray experiment is a long list of genes with corresponding expression measurements. This list is only the starting point for a meaningful biological interpretation. Modern methods identify relevant biological processes or functions from gene expression data by scoring the statistical significance of predefined functional gene groups, e.g. based on Gene Ontology (GO). We develop methods that increase the explanatory power of this approach by integrating knowledge about relationships between the GO terms into the calculation of the statistical significance.Results: We present two novel algorithms that improve GO group scoring using the underlying GO graph topology. The algorithms are evaluated on real and simulated gene expression data. We show that both methods eliminate local dependencies between GO terms and point to relevant areas in the GO graph that remain undetected with state-of-the-art algorithms for scoring functional terms. A simulation study demonstrates that the new methods exhibit a higher level of detecting relevant biological terms than competing methods.Availability: topgo.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.deContact:  alexa@mpi-sb.mpg.deSupplementary Information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

The DAVID Gene system was rebuilt to gain coverage of more organisms, which increased the taxonomy coverage from 17 399 to 55 464. All existing annotation types have been updated, if available, based on the new DAVID Gene system. Compared with the last version, the number of gene-term records for most annotation types within the updated Knowledgebase have significantly increased. Moreover, we have incorporated new annotations in the Knowledgebase including small molecule-gene interactions from PubChem, drug-gene interactions from DrugBank, tissue expression information from the Human Protein Atlas, disease information from DisGeNET, and pathways from WikiPathways and PathBank. Eight of ten subgroups split from Uniprot Keyword annotation were assigned to specific types. Finally, we added a species parameter for uploading a list of gene symbols to minimize the ambiguity between species, which increases the efficiency of the list upload and eliminates confusion for users. These current updates have significantly expanded the Knowledgebase and enhanced the discovery power of DAVID.,

	abstract = {Background Gene-set enrichment analysis is a useful technique to help functionally characterize large gene lists, such as the results of gene expression experiments. This technique finds functionally coherent gene-sets, such as pathways, that are statistically over-represented in a given gene list. Ideally, the number of resulting sets is smaller than the number of genes in the list, thus simplifying interpretation. However, the increasing number and redundancy of gene-sets used by many current enrichment analysis software works against this ideal. Principal Findings To overcome gene-set redundancy and help in the interpretation of large gene lists, we developed “Enrichment Map”, a network-based visualization method for gene-set enrichment results. Gene-sets are organized in a network, where each set is a node and edges represent gene overlap between sets. Automated network layout groups related gene-sets into network clusters, enabling the user to quickly identify the major enriched functional themes and more easily interpret the enrichment results. Conclusions Enrichment Map is a significant advance in the interpretation of enrichment analysis. Any research project that generates a list of genes can take advantage of this visualization framework. Enrichment Map is implemented as a freely available and user friendly plug-in for the Cytoscape network visualization software (http://baderlab.org/Software/EnrichmentMap/).},

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

This is challenging, however, when relevant differences are subtle at the level of individual genes. We introduce an analytical strategy, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, designed to detect modest but coordinate changes in the expression of groups of functionally related genes. Using this approach, we identify a set of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation whose expression is coordinately decreased in human diabetic muscle. Expression of these genes is high at sites of insulin-mediated glucose disposal, activated by PGC-1α and correlated with total-body aerobic capacity. Our results associate this gene set with clinically important variation in human metabolism and illustrate the value of pathway relationships in the analysis of genomic profiling experiments.},

In addition to eight established algorithms, we also included Coincident Extreme Ranks in Numerical Observations (CERNO), a flexible and fast algorithm based on modified Fisher P-value integration. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that CERNO is robust to ranking metrics, as well as sample and GS size. CERNO had the highest reproducibility while remaining sensitive, specific and fast. In the overall ranking Pathway Analysis with Down-weighting of Overlapping Genes, CERNO and over-representation analysis performed best, while CERNO and GeneSetTest scored high in terms of reproducibility.tmod package implementing the CERNO algorithm is available from CRAN (cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tmod/index.html) and an online implementation can be found at http://tmod.online/.

	abstract = {The prediction of transcription factor (TF) activities from the gene expression of their targets (i.e., TF regulon) is becoming a widely used approach to characterize the functional status of transcriptional regulatory circuits. Several strategies and data sets have been proposed to link the target genes likely regulated by a TF, each one providing a different level of evidence. The most established ones are (1) manually curated repositories, (2) interactions derived from ChIP-seq binding data, (3) in silico prediction of TF binding on gene promoters, and (4) reverse-engineered regulons from large gene expression data sets. However, it is not known how these different sources of regulons affect the TF activity estimations and, thereby, downstream analysis and interpretation. Here we compared the accuracy and biases of these strategies to define human TF regulons by means of their ability to predict changes in TF activities in three reference benchmark data sets. We assembled a collection of TF–target interactions for 1541 human TFs and evaluated how different molecular and regulatory properties of the TFs, such as the DNA-binding domain, specificities, or mode of interaction with the chromatin, affect the predictions of TF activity. We assessed their coverage and found little overlap on the regulons derived from each strategy and better performance by literature-curated information followed by ChIP-seq data. We provide an integrated resource of all TF–target interactions derived through these strategies, with confidence scores, as a resource for enhanced prediction of TF activities.},

Despite sustained recognition of autologous virus, HIV-speciﬁc proliferative and cytolytic T cell effector functions became selectively and intrinsically impaired prior to aborted control. Longitudinal transcriptomic proﬁling of functionally impaired HIV-speciﬁc CD8+ T cells revealed altered expression of genes related to activation, cytokine-mediated signaling, and cell cycle regulation, including increased expression of the antiproliferative transcription factor KLF2 but not of genes associated with canonical exhaustion. Lymphoid HIV-speciﬁc CD8+ T cells also exhibited poor functionality during aborted control relative to durable control. Our results identify selective functional impairment of HIV-speciﬁc CD8+ T cells as prognostic of impending aborted HIV control, with implications for clinical monitoring and immunotherapeutic strategies.},

To address this, we investigated functionality, clonotypic compartmentalization, spatial localization, phenotypic characteristics, and transcriptional profiles of LN-resident virus-specific CD8+ T cells in persons who control HIV without medications. Antigen-induced proliferative and cytolytic potential consistently distinguished spontaneous controllers from noncontrollers. T cell receptor analysis revealed complete clonotypic overlap between peripheral and LN-resident HIV-specific CD8+ T cells. Transcriptional analysis of LN CD8+ T cells revealed gene signatures of inflammatory chemotaxis and antigen-induced effector function. In HIV controllers, the cytotoxic effectors perforin and granzyme B were elevated among virus-specific CXCR5+ fCD8s proximate to foci of HIV RNA within germinal centers. These results provide evidence consistent with cytolytic control of lymphotropic infection supported by inflammatory recruitment, antigen-specific proliferation, and cytotoxicity of fCD8s., Antigen-driven follicular CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity contributes to immune control of HIV replication within germinal centers.},
